## Script for balance calculations and optimization of the composition of crop collections

This repository contains tools for diagnosis and optimization of the composition of crop collections.

The script developed by H. Reyes-Valdes is in the file *RelativeBalance.R* and contains functions for divergence,
relative balance and optimization.

Check the file tutorial.pdf for a guide on the use of the R functions. The example data in the TriticumClassType_Paper.csv was taken
from passport records of the CIMMYT wheat collection
